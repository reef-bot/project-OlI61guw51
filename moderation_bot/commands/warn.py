```python
# Import necessary modules
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

# Define the WarnCog class
class WarnCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot

    # Command to issue a warning to a user
    @commands.command(name='warn', help='Warn a user for inappropriate behavior')
    async def warn_user(self, ctx, user: discord.Member, reason: str):
        # Implement the logic to issue a warning to the user
        # This could include sending a warning message, logging the warning, etc.
        await ctx.send(f'Warning issued to {user.mention} for: {reason}')

# Setup function to add the WarnCog to the bot
def setup(bot):
    bot.add_cog(WarnCog(bot))
```

Explanation:
- The `WarnCog` class defines a cog for the warn functionality in the bot.
- The `warn_user` function is a command that allows a user to issue a warning to another user for inappropriate behavior.
- The `setup` function adds the `WarnCog` to the bot. This allows the bot to recognize and execute the warn command.
